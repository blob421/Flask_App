Introduction :

This repository contains the back-end of my web app. It is currently deployed on Azure and it interacts with my front-end and an AZURE SQL database on
the cloud. Data on cryptocurrencies is fetched using a containerized version of my Fetch script running on Azure. It updates a plotly graph 
in real time and handles user logins.

More features are to come . See my vue app for more information.
